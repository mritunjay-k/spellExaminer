# spellExaminer

One stop shop for all your spelling checks. Just run this program and provide a text file which you want to check.

Steps to use it are as follows:

1. There must a bash file named 'requirements.sh' in the repository. Run it as: ~$ sudo bash requirements.sh (Don't forget to give the 'sudo', otherwise it'll create a mess)
2. Now you're good to go. Run the python file as: ~$ ./spellExaminer.py
3. Provide it the text file which you want to check.
4. See where you went wrong.

#### One thing to notice here is that if this file didn't find any mistake in the file then it must be beacuse of two reasons:
1. Either you must be an excellent writer.
2. Or, the mistake done by you is already present present in the python Library and isn't considered a 'mistake' by the creators of Python, which is highly unlikely.
